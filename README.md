# Project: Memory Card

## Description

First React project using functional components. 

Learned the basics by creating an app which makes heavy use of state, effects (lifecycle) to shuffle through a json containing Game of Thrones characters' data. The json contains links to images of said characters which are used to load images asynchronously and display them when they are all loaded, else display a spinning loading icon.
